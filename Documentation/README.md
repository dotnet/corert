# Introduction to CoreRT Repo

This is the repo for CoreRT, the .NET Core runtime optimized for AOT (Ahead of Time) compilation scenarios. This project is in early stages of its development. [The high-level engineering plan](high-level-engineering-plan.md) lists major parts that needs to come together for it to become a complete runtime for .NET Core.
