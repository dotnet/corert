/* When building for code coverage runs, this creates the classes necessary to 
 * call hit using the correct pinvoke signature for the toolchain. It uses the "/UseManagedProxy"
 * version of instrumentation because that only introduces two IL instructions per hit, and is 
 * thus easier fix up afterwards.
 * 
 * The array in the static constructor will be replaced during fixup with the array that was
 * created to register System.Private.CoreLib.dll
